# Change History

## Version 0.2

Version retouched by Roland Chastain, starting from [the original program][1] and borrowing ideas to [version 0.1][2] by Jim Ablett.

(The version 0.1 is older than the code currently available on James Stanley's repository. That's why I didn't use it as a starting point.)

* Define SEARCHDEPTH at compile time
* Support `protover 2` CECP command
